TASEA: Extraction correlation between different time series


Description
===========

TASEA is a research approach developed at david.uvsq.fr lab by mch.raef@gmail.com.
This python based software allows importing data from classified multivate time series, in order to analyse it
using data mining techniques and find the correlation between different extracted information from differnet time series.

It allows building time annotated sequences from different shapelets that can be extended later on as a rule for
Complex Event Processing engines
